<p><strong>Basically what our site is about:</strong></p>
<p><strong>we have tutorials on how to do makeup, we also have skin care for you and what we prefer for you to use. There is pictures of the makeup looks and all you have to do is look at the pictures, pick them out, and then read what you need down below and look at the picture and try to copy the look. I feel like this site is very helpful if you are trying to get clear skin, or even if you just want to achieve a fun makeup look.</strong></p>
